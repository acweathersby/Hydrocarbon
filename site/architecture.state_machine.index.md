# [Architecture](./architecture.index.md)::State Machine

A parser generated by Hydrocarbon is compiled to [bytecode](./architecture.bytecode.index.md) designed to run on a virtual state machine. This state machine is implemented as efficeiently
as possible as modules available in each target language. The state machine can be thought of as parse kernel that emits [regonizer parse actions](./architecture.recognizer_parse_actions.index.md) that specific implementations can use break up an input into tokens which then can combine them into [AST](./api.asytrip.index.md)s or execute code based on the token information. 

The basic flow of a parse state is as follows: The first instruction is decoded and the appropriate handler is called. If it is a branch action,
as is the case with the `TABLE_BR` and `HASH_BR` instructions, then a scanner pass may be initiated. The scanner states use the same architecture as 
normal parse states save for a few notable differences: 
- Scanner states do not generate parse actions for the completer
- Scanner state branches do not utilize the `token` lexer mode. They instead have access to `byte`, `codepoint` and `class` lexer modes.
- The completion of a scanner parser yields `token_type` and `token_length` values which can then be used by parse states to branch to 
appropriate states that ultimately consume the token span.

- `FAIL` flag
- State Decoder
- Instruction Dispatch

Byte code buffer:

Every bytecode buffer contains the following values in word positions
`0x0`-`0x5`. This means that first state of a compiled grammar is found at 
`0x6` 

[source file](../source/typescript/build/bytecode.ts)

- `0x0` Default Fail Instruction
- `0x1` Default Pass Instruction
- `0x2` Default Fall Through Instruction
- `0x3` NOOP
- `0x4` Default Pass State Pointer
- `0x5` NOOP


```rust
use candlelib_hydrocarbon::completer::complete;
use candlelib_hydrocarbon::recognizer::recognize;

let (mut valid, mut invalid) = run(
        instructions.as_ptr(),
        instructions.len(),
        input.as_ptr(),
        input.len(),
        67109064,
    );

complete(input.as_ptr(), input.len(), &mut valid);

```
