### Pointer

![Pointer SVG](./resources/img/Pointer)


Every state is represented by a series of bytecode instructions stored in 
the instruction buffer. A pointer is used to locate the head of a state's 
instruction sequence. When parsing, an entry pointer is passed as an argument
to the recognizer to start the parsing at a suitable entry state.
