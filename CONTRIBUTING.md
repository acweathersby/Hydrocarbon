# Contributing

Hydrocarbon is a young project and there are many opportunities to improve it in various
ways. Before you dig into the code, I recommend you checkout the [architecture documents](./site/architecture.index.md) to gain a high level 
understanding of the inner workings of Hydrocarbon. This should set on a good path to making improvements
to the code base. 

### Pull Requests

There you have it! You've made some improvements, added some documentation, and are ready to merge
your changes into the main branch. There are a few things that can make your PR standout and fast
track for merging.
